        Industrial roads serve industrial land uses and provide freight connections to regional transportation facilities such as interstate and state highways.

        These streets are designed to accommodate a significant volume of large trucks providing freight services for industry.

        <Field name="Typical Street Classification">
            * City Walkway 
            * City Bikeway 
            * Local Service or Transit Access 
            * Major City Traffic 
            * Priority Truck Street 
            * Major Emergency Response
        </Field>

        <Field name="Typical Travel-Way Width">
            56'-72'
        </Field>

        <Field name="Travel Lanes">
            Typically include two to four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Pedestrian">
            Sidewalks serve pedestrians accessing places of employment, limited commercial uses, and transit service.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Greening">
            Street trees are located in a continuous planter strip. Some Industrial Roads are lined by street trees that were planted behind the sidewalk.

            Freight routes, industrial areas, and busy streets typically have the highest pollutant loads, making water quality treatment critical. Stormwater management may need to be placed underground to meet freight traffic constraints.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Bicycle">
            Protected bike lanes or off-street multi-use paths are the preferred facilities to separate people bicycling from heavy vehicles on Industrial Roads.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Transit">
            Approximately half of Portland's Industrial Roads support transit service. A few have the highest transit classification that may require space in the road or at signals for transit priority treatments.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Freight">
            Industrial Roads serve a high volume of freight traffic and are designed to accommodate large vehicles through wider lane widths and turning radii.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Curbside Access">
            Parking for land uses along Industrial Roads is generally served on site, though some Industrial Roads require truck staging areas within the roadway.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Place Creation">
            Community uses in the curb zone are not appropriate on Industrial Roads due to higher speeds and volumes of large vehicles.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Emergency Response">
         Industrial Roads are typically Major Emergency Response routes, which informs the use of vertical constraints adjacent to travel lanes (e.g., medians, protected bike lanes)
