        Civic Main Streets are generally Portland's busiest, widest streets that pass through compact, pedestrian-oriented Centers that anchor neighborhoods with retail and businesses, schools and libraries, housing options, employment centers, and gathering places.

        Civic Main Streets emphasize multimodal access to destinations, while accommodating mobility for all modes.

            * City/Major City Bikeway
            * Major Transit Priority

        <Field name="Typical Travel-Way Width">
            56'-76'
        </Field>

        <Field name="Travel Lanes">
            Typically include two to four vehicle lanes, with additional turning lanes as needed.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Pedestrian">
            Civic Main Streets have the widest sidewalks in the city to accommodate high demand generated by local destinations and transit. Sidewalks are also used for community uses such as sidewalk cafes, outdoor retail displays, or seating.

            Closely spaced marked crossings support pedestrian mobility, safety, and access to transit. Designs such as median islands and pedestrian signals may be used to shorten crossing distances and stop traffic as appropriate.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Greening">
            Greening functions related to tree canopy and stormwater management typically occur in the furnishing zone or in tree-lined medians to create distinctive, memorable places and offset the presence of wide paved areas. Tree planting locations and species may depend upon the location of above or below ground utilities.

            Green infrastructure is the preferred way to manage stormwater, and can be placed either in the furnishing zone or curb zone. The curb zone requires careful consideration of mobility needs to ensure green infrastructure is consistent with transit priority and planned bikeways.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Bicycle">
            Often part of the planned bicycle network, bicycle facilities along Civic Corridors may need to narrow when entering a designated Center to accommodate access demands associated with Main Streets. Street design should consider reducing vehicular capacity or on-street parking to minimize compromises to the bicycle facility. Designs that slow speeds and mitigate conflicts with parked vehicles should be considered when narrowing bicycle facilities.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Transit">
            Civic Main Streets are typically Major Transit Priority routes serving access to the many destinations within centers. Priority treatments such as queue bypasses may be needed to traverse congested Civic Main Street sections.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Freight">
            Typically designated as Major Truck or Truck Access Streets, these classifications inform the extent to which street design accommodates truck needs in balance with other modal needs and whether through freight trips are discouraged. Heavy and medium-duty commercial vehicles have similar needs as transit vehicles in terms of lane widths and turning radii. Access for goods loading/unloading is often needed at commercial destinations.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Curbside Access">
            Civic Main Streets emphasize multimodal access to adjacent residential, commercial, and employment uses through on-street parking, bike corrals, transit stops, loading, delivery, and shared mobility. Access and loading needs may also be accommodated on one side of the street, side streets, or off-street to enable mobility uses in the curb zone.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Place Creation">
            Where on-street parking/loading is provided, community- or commercial-uses, such as Street Seats, may be placed in the curb zone to provide additional gathering or commercial space. Streets Seats are most appropriate on streets with three or fewer travel lanes to provide a comfortable environment.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Emergency Response">
            Civic Main Streets are typically Major Emergency Response routes, which informs the use of vertical constraints adjacent to travel lanes (e.g., medians, protected bike lanes).
