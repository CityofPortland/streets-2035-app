    # Civic Main Streets

    <section class="text-xl text-fog-900">
        Civic Main Streets are Portland’s busiest, widest streets that pass through compact, pedestrian-oriented Centers which anchor neighborhoods with retail and businesses, public services like schools and libraries, housing options, employment centers, and gathering places.

        Civic Main Streets are characterized by public realm design that invites people to linger and provides business access, and an emphasis on access to the many destinations in and around them by all modes of transportation.

    <Field name="Typical Street Classification">
        * [Major City Walkway](https://portland-tsp.com/#/text#major-city-walkways) 
        * City/Major City Bikeway 
        * Major Transit Priority

    <Field name="Typical Travel-Way Width">
        56’-76’
    </Field>

    <Field name="Pedestrian">
        Civic Main Streets have the widest sidewalks in the city to accommodate high pedestrian demand generated by local destinations and transit. Sidewalks along Civic Main Streets are also used for community uses such as sidewalk cafes, outdoor retail displays, or seating.

        Closely spaced pedestrian crossings support pedestrian mobility, safety, and access to transit. Design treatments such as median islands and pedestrian signals shorten the length of crossings and stop traffic as appropriate on the largest and busiest roadways.
    </Field>

    <Field name="Transit">
        Civic Main Streets are typically Major Transit Priority routes serving access to the many destinations within centers. While street design first looks to adjacent Civic Corridors to provide transit priority to keep buses running on time, priority treatments may also be needed to traverse congested Civic Main Street sections.
    </Field>

    <Field name="Bike">
        Often part of the planned bike network, bicycle facilities along Civic Corridors may narrow when entering a designated Center in order to accommodate the addition access demands associated with Main Streets. Designs that slow speeds and mitigate conflicts with parked vehicles should be considered when narrowing bicycle facilities.
    </Field>

    <Field name="Greening">
        Street trees and other plantings in the furnishing zone are accommodated in tree wells to enhance the public realm adjacent to destinations. Trees may also be planted in medians, where provided, depending on the location of underground utilities.

        Green infrastructure in the curb zone may be possible but requires careful consideration of existing and future mobility needs to ensure infrastructure is consistent with transit priority and planned bikeways [perhaps this sentence should be a global consideration instead or also].
    </Field>

    <Field name="Freight">
        Civic Main Streets are typically freight routes. Generally designated Major Truck Streets or Truck Access streets, these classifications inform the extent to which street design accommodates truck needs in balance with other modal needs and whether through freight trips are discouraged. Freight vehicles have similar needs as transit vehicles in terms of lane widths and turning radii.
    </Field>

    <Field name="Curbside Access">
        Civic Main Streets emphasize multimodal access to adjacent residential, commercial and employment uses through on-street parking, loading, and shared mobility. Access and loading needs may also be accommodated on one side of the street, on side streets, or on site to enable mobility uses in the curb zone.
    </Field>

    <Field name="Place Creation">
        Where on-street parking/loading is provided, Street Seats may be placed in the curb zone to provide additional community gathering space. Streets Seats are appropriate on streets with three or fewer lanes to provide a comfortable environment.
