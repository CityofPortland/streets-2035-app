All streets in Portland have a role in fostering, absorbing, and sustaining the impacts of a growing city. Portland’s Transportation System Plan (TSP) includes a “Street Design” classification which assigns each street a “type” based on a combination of the transportation function and the adjacent land use context. These “Street Types” are the foundational element of the Streets 2035 decision-making framework.

The street type descriptions identify general design priorities and considerations for each street type. While Street Types portray a vision for how the right-of-way should be allocated based on city policies, they are intended to be flexible because the context of each street varies greatly throughout the city in terms of their transportation needs, land use, type of buildings, landscape and natural environment.

The illustrations provided for each Street Type show just one or two examples of the multiple ways in which the available right-of-way space could be allocated according to that Street Type.

      Civic Main Streets are generally Portland’s busiest, widest streets that pass through compact, pedestrian-oriented Centers that anchor neighborhoods with retail and businesses, schools and libraries, housing options, employment centers, and gathering places.

      Civic Corridors are generally Portland’s busiest, widest, and most prominent streets. As the city grows, Civic Corridors are increasingly lined with multifamily residential and commercial mixed-use developments.

      Neighborhood Main Streets are mid-sized streets that pass through smaller neighborhood-serving Centers. These centers support vibrant business districts and residential buildings, bringing amenities, goods, and services within walking distance of neighborhood residents.

      Neighborhood Corridors are generally mid-sized streets that connect surrounding neighborhoods to each other and with other parts of the city. They are zoned to accommodate Portland’s growth of residential and commercial buildings in the coming years, but at a smaller scale than Civic Corridors.

      Community Corridors are generally mid-sized streets that connect surrounding neighborhoods to each other. Community Corridors are not planned for major growth and feature mostly lower-density residential land uses, some small-scale retail, and neighborhood destinations such as parks and schools.
