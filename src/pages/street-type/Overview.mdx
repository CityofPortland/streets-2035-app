  # Street types

All streets in Portland have a role in fostering, absorbing, and sustaining the impacts of a growing city. Portland's Transportation System Plan (TSP) includes a “Street Design” classification which assigns each street a “type” based on a combination of the transportation function and the adjacent land use context. These “Street Types” are the foundational element of the StreetsPDX decision-making framework.

        The image illustrates the street design classification hierarchy. It also
        shows how much of the 2,090 miles of streets each classification
        encompasses.

    Street types portray a vision for how the right-of-way should be allocated based on city policies. They are also intended to be flexible because the context of each street varies greatly throughout the city. Each street varies in terms of their transportation needs, land use, type of buildings, landscape and natural environment.

    The street types below identify general design priorities and considerations. There is a link for each street type to find more information. The illustrations provided for each Street Type show just one or two fictional examples of the multiple ways in which the available right-of-way space could be allocated according to that Street Type.

        </h2>

        Neighborhood Corridors are generally mid-sized streets that connect surrounding neighborhoods to each other and with other parts of the city. They are zoned to accommodate Portland's growth of residential and commercial buildings in the coming years, but at a smaller scale than Civic Corridors.
