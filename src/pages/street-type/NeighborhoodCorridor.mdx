        Neighborhood Corridors are generally mid-sized streets that connect surrounding neighborhoods to each other and with other parts of the city. They are zoned to accommodate Portland's growth of residential and commercial buildings in the coming years, but at a smaller scale than Civic Corridors.

        Neighborhood Corridors emphasize multimodal mobility between activity centers, while accommodating access to adjacent land uses.

        <Field name="Typical Street Classification">
            * Major City Walkway
            * City/Major City Bikeway
            * Major Transit Priority or Transit Access
            * Neighborhood/District Collector

        <Field name="Typical Travel-Way Width">
            36'-50'
        </Field>

        <Field name="Travel Lanes">
            Typically include two vehicle lanes with additional turning lanes as needed.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Pedestrian">
            Sidewalks on accommodate medium volumes of pedestrians traveling along the street and accessing destinations, including transit.

            Enhanced crossings facilitate access to transit and dense, diverse land uses. Designs such as warning signage and beacons may be present to contribute to pedestrian safety.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Greening">
            Street trees are located in tree wells or a continuous planter strip, depending upon adjacent land use. Where space allows and safe sight lines can be maintained, median refuge islands may also be planted. Tree planting locations and species may depend upon the location of above or below ground utilities.

            Green infrastructure is the preferred way to manage stormwater. In locations with high transportation priorities, facilities in the furnishing zone may be preferred. If space behind the curb is limited stormwater facilities can be constructed in the curb-zone and can support traffic calming, shorten pedestrian crossing distances, and increase planting areas for larger street trees.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Bicycle">
            Depending on automobile speeds and volumes Neighborhood Corridors support bicycle transportation with buffered or protected bike lanes. When delay to transit, freight, or traffic is unacceptable on these (typically) narrow corridors, bicycles may be moved to parallel streets.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Transit">
            Neighborhood Corridors are well served by transit, and where they have the highest transit designation (Major Transit Priority), transit priority treatments will make use of the curb zone and in some conditions repurpose travel lanes to improve transit speed and reliability.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Freight">
            Most Neighborhood Corridors do not have the highest freight classification, though several do have classifications that reflect their importance for the movement of goods and services. Some are Truck Access Streets, which are often used for deliveries by smaller commercial vehicles.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Curbside Access">
            Neighborhood Corridors prioritize the curb zone for multimodal mobility, including transit stops. Parking and loading are preferably served off-street or on side streets, although on-street parking or loading may be provided where space allows to support adjacent land uses.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Place Creation">
            Curb zone community space is not prioritized on Neighborhood Corridors as the curb zone is largely reserved for mobility and adjacent land uses less frequently require or support outdoor seating.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Emergency Response">
            Neighborhood Corridors are typically Major Emergency Response routes, which informs the use of vertical constraints adjacent to travel lanes (e.g., medians, protected bike lanes).
