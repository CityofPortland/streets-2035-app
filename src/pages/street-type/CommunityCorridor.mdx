        Community Corridors are generally mid-sized streets that connect surrounding neighborhoods to each other. Community Corridors are not planned for major growth and feature mostly lower-density residential land uses, some small-scale retail, and neighborhood destinations such as parks and schools.

        Community Corridors emphasize multimodal mobility and vary in character across the city's geography, or <Anchor url="https://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/index.cfm?a=288085&c=52254">pattern areas</Anchor> as identified in the 2035 Comprehensive Plan.

        <Field name="Typical Travel-Way Width">
            22'-44'
        </Field>

        <Field name="Travel Lanes">
            Typically include two vehicle lanes with additional turning lanes as needed.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Pedestrian">
            Sidewalks accommodate moderate volumes of pedestrians accessing neighborhood destinations, including transit. Crossings are frequent but may require less robust infrastructure when motor vehicle volumes are low.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Greening">
            Street trees are located in a continuous planter strip or tree wells depending upon adjacent land use. Tree planting locations and species may depend upon the location of above or below ground utilities.

            Green infrastructure is the preferred way to manage stormwater.. Where space allows and the curb zone is not planned for future bike lanes, curb extensions may provide space for green stormwater infrastructure.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Bicycle">
            Most Community Corridors are on the planned bike network. Bicycle facility type, as on all roadways, is determined based on automobile speeds and volumes.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Transit">
            About half of Portland's Community Corridors support transit service, though few have the highest transit classification that may require space in the road or at signals for transit priority treatments.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Freight">
            Most Community Corridors do not have the highest freight classification, but many are important for the movement of goods and services. Some are Truck Access Streets, which are often used for deliveries by smaller commercial vehicles.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Curbside Access">
            Community Corridors prioritize the curb zone for multimodal mobility, including transit stops, with residential access needs served off-street or on side streets. Periodic on-street parking or loading may be interspersed where it supports adjacent commercial land use and allows continuous bikeway facilities (where present).
        </Field>

        <Field name="Place Creation">
            Community space generally is not a priority use of the curb zone given that Community Corridors emphasize mobility and do not typically have adjacent land uses that require or support outdoor seating.
        </Field>

        <Field name="Emergency Response">
         Community Corridors are typically Major Emergency Response routes, which informs the use of vertical constraints adjacent to travel lanes (e.g., medians, protected bike lanes).

         On Secondary Response Routes, speed bumps may be an available tool to reduce speeds and volumes and should be “fire friendly.”
