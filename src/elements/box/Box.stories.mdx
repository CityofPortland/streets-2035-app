# Boxes
The Box element is the most generic element in our component library and serves as a basis for many higher level components. It provides very basic coloring properties to ensure that accessibility standards are met no matter what choice is made.

## Variants

Each color theme has three variants associated with it: `light`, `neutral`, and `dark`. The default option is `neutral`, and provides a way to draw attention to something typically, but don't usually work for longer reading. The `neutral` variant is best used for call to action elements as they draw attention against a white background. The `light` variant is useful to maintain a light background and denote the color chosen well, but be useful for longer bits of text inside. Messages should use this `light` variant. The `dark` variant is useful with longer strings of text as well when you want to provide an alternative environment or provide a lot of contrast to a section of your application.
